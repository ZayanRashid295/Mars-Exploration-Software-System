# Mars Exploration Software System

## Overview
The Mars Exploration Software System is a Python-based application developed to facilitate the simulation of Mars exploration activities. The system simulates the Martian surface, rovers, spacecraft, and hypothetical alien encounters, providing a virtual environment for testing and evaluating mission strategies and algorithms.

## Features
- Representation of the Martian surface as a 2D grid.
- Autonomous rovers capable of movement, rock collection, and interaction with the spacecraft.
- A stationary spacecraft serving as a hub for recharging rovers, retrieving rocks, and coordinating rover activities.
- Hypothetical alien behavior, including random movement and attacks on nearby rovers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- NumPy (for array operations)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ZayanRashid295/Mars-Exploration-Software-System.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mars-exploration`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the main script: `python main.py`
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to set simulation parameters and start the simulation.
3. Monitor the simulation progress and analyze the results.

## Configuration
- Adjust simulation parameters such as grid size, number of rovers, and alien behavior in the configuration file (`config.py`).
